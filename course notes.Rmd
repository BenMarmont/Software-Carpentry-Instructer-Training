# Preparation:
* completed pre-workshop survey
* note there will be 'homework' for after conclusion of the course 
* read 'carpentries 2020 annual report'
* read 'the science of learning'
  
## Carpentries Annual Report Notes:
 * notes verbal and non-verbal biases when teaching and their effects
    * mission (summary):        
        * Increase global data and computational skills used best practice (inclusive, open-access, and evidence based)
    * values: act openly, empower, value all contributions, always learning, people first, access for all, community collaboration, strength through diversity
    * Helped with Glosario, a online global lens glossary of data science terms
    * In 2020 carpentries spent USD$250k on instructor training

## Science of Learning Notes:
  * summary of research from cognitive science about how people learn
    * resource for educators 
    * not a be all and end all for new teachers, but an insight into cognition
    * produced by a non-profit; 'Deans for Impact'
    * Six questions are universal true in teaching, these are how the document is framed
    
 1) _How do students understand new ideas?_
    * students learn new ideas by building on those they already know
      * a sequential curriculum is therefore essential
      * analogies linked ideas are key, but have to be well described
    * information must be moved from short term to long term memory
      * students have limited short term memory
      * if cognitive load is too much learning will stall
      * if multiple communication channels are employed the message must be the same
    * Prequsites should be just that for learning, not age based requirements for content
    
  2) _How do students learn and retain new information?_ 
      * students remember information as it goes in
      * practice is a requirement for learning, but it should be spaced out and interleaved with other practice
    
  3) _How do students solve problems?_
      * subjects areas have sets of facts that underpin everything
       * if these are committed to memeory work-memory is freed up
       * learning by wrote does have its place
     * feedback is essential 
        * good feedback is:
         * specific and clear
         * focused on task, not student
         * focused on improvement not performance
        
  4) _How does learning transfer to new situations in or outside of the classroom?_
      * Problem solving requires understanding the context and structure of a problem
        * teaching background is essential to real-world problem solving 
     * Examples are great for new ideas, but in can be difficult when using different examples
       * teachers can set tasks that have different surfaces but the same underlying structure 
       * can encourage students to label sub-steps where appropriate
       * can substitute word problems with formulas where appropriate
      
  5) _What motivates students to learn?_
    * beliefs about intelligence are important predictors of behaviour at school
      * communicating with students that they can improve their intelligence via learning and feel in control of it 
    * pure interest learning has better long term outcomes that controlled learning  
    * praise and reward should be employed strategically depending on motivations
    * feeling a sense of belonging and acceptanc eimproves academic outcomes
    
  6) _What are the common misconceptions about how students learn and think?_
      * Students do NOT have different learning styles
      * Humans do NOT only use 10% of their brains
      * People do NOT use left/right brain preferentially
      * Novices and experts cannot think in all the same ways
      * Cognitive development should NOT be gatekept by age
