# Preparation:
* completed pre-workshop survey
* note there will be 'homework' for after conclusion of the course 
* read 'carpentries 2020 annual report'
* read 'the science of learning'
  
## Carpentries Annual Report Notes:
 * notes verbal and non-verbal biases when teaching and their effects
    * mission (summary):        
        * Increase global data and computational skills used best practice (inclusive, open-access, and evidence based)
    * values: act openly, empower, value all contributions, always learning, people first, access for all, community collaboration, strength through diversity
    * Helped with Glosario, a online global lens glossary of data science terms
    * In 2020 carpentries spent USD$250k on instructor training

## Science of Learning Notes:
  * summary of research from cognitive science about how people learn
    * resource for educators 
    * not a be all and end all for new teachers, but an insight into cognition
    * produced by a non-profit; 'Deans for Impact'
    * Six questions are universal true in teaching, these are how the document is framed
    
 1) _How do students understand new ideas?_
    * students learn new ideas by building on those they already know
      * a sequential curriculum is therefore essential
      * analogies linked ideas are key, but have to be well described
    * information must be moved from short term to long term memory
      * students have limited short term memory
      * if cognitive load is too much learning will stall
      * if multiple communication channels are employed the message must be the same
    * Prequsites should be just that for learning, not age based requirements for content
    
  2) _How do students learn and retain new information?_ 
      * students remember information as it goes in
      * practice is a requirement for learning, but it should be spaced out and interleaved with other practice
    
  3) _How do students solve problems?_
      * subjects areas have sets of facts that underpin everything
       * if these are committed to memeory work-memory is freed up
       * learning by wrote does have its place
     * feedback is essential 
        * good feedback is:
           * specific and clear
           * focused on task, not student
           * focused on improvement not performance
        
  4) _How does learning transfer to new situations in or outside of the classroom?_
      * Problem solving requires understanding the context and structure of a problem
        * teaching background is essential to real-world problem solving 
     * Examples are great for new ideas, but in can be difficult when using different examples
       * teachers can set tasks that have different surfaces but the same underlying structure 
       * can encourage students to label sub-steps where appropriate
       * can substitute word problems with formulas where appropriate
      
  5) _What motivates students to learn?_
    * beliefs about intelligence are important predictors of behaviour at school
      * communicating with students that they can improve their intelligence via learning and feel in control of it 
    * pure interest learning has better long term outcomes that controlled learning  
    * praise and reward should be employed strategically depending on motivations
    * feeling a sense of belonging and acceptanc eimproves academic outcomes
    
  6) _What are the common misconceptions about how students learn and think?_
      * Students do NOT have different learning styles
      * Humans do NOT only use 10% of their brains
      * People do NOT use left/right brain preferentially
      * Novices and experts cannot think in all the same ways
      * Cognitive development should NOT be gatekept by age
         
         
## Preparing presentation
  * 90 second intro early in course
  * 3 minute presentation later in the course
  
90 second intro:
* R is a free, open-source software for (mostly) all things data with a large and growing community
 and extensive packages (free add-ons) for any number of tasks
* before we begin please check you hae R Studio and R installed. The former is an IDE, the later is a console input.
* the first thing we are going to do today is look at inflamation in patients so we will need to import the relevant CSV, ensure that after downloading it you unzip it so that R can read it! 

# Day 1! 
Used etherpad for collaboration, a re-skinned google doc 
Three instructor instructors, 2 Otago, one Canterbury. PhDs.
Please keep microphones muted and cameras on.
Etherpad is used extensively for collaboration

Schedule:
  1000 start
  1130 10min break
  1230 45min lunch
  1400 10min break
  3 end

After everyone introduced themselves entirely academic audience.
Types of carpentry workshops:
Software - foundational computational skills
data - effect work with data and its lifecycle
library - library and IT personal focused

Experience levels
* Novice (don't know what they don't know, can't formulate questions)
    * General carpentries attendees
* Competent Practitioner (knows enough to do everyday tasks, even though it may not be right)
* Expert(handles unexpected things well)
The different experience levels can be visualised with different mental models where there are greater connections between concepts as experience increases.

My analogy:
Modelling is like weeds taking over your garden, unless you make an effort to keep it in a given state they will keep growing
  - but you want analogies to be simple and specific with no room for ambiguity
  
Concept maps are a useful tool for lesson planning  

Mental models can easily be constructed differently than intended. Teaching is about fixing mental models.

Formative assessments can be used to correct mental models.
Formative assessments: Useful to teacher and learner, gives learner an idea about their knowledge and gaps.
Summative assessments: Like final exam, assessment of knowledge. No scope for further practice

In formative assessment if answers are spread across all questions it could be a symptom of guessing and studens not having a mental model capable of answering the question. Experts are far better and spotting and solving errors.
 * You need to be very explicit with step by step instructions, especially regarding errors.

Formative assessment is good, but there is a trade off between that and actual content.

Different experience levels like different learning levels, for example, novices can find lots of facts early counterproductive, while expert
  - If people find courses too slow they will be bored, and if its too fast the student won't return. Establishing correct mental models is essential.

Novices don't necessarily have the vocabulary to google solutions to their problems.

We should be careful not use dismissive tones when teaching, for example what may same trivial to us may be lessintuitive to students. For example, instead of saying just open a browser, omitting the 'just' removes the disimissive tone from the sentence.

Asking what questions do you have is phrased more positively than any questions, where the latter has the tone of wanting to moving along quickly.
