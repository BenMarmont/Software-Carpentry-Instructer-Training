# Feedback:
# Postive
#   * Pace was good, he disagreed that I should have gone faster
#     * If I am unsure about pace, ask learners whom can offer feedback
#   * Showing file location in explorer was good
#   * The help and about read_csv was good
#   * Repeating how to do things in earlier lessons is not a bad thing

# Improve
#   * Give more time to context i.e. context, what we expect out of the lesson and what 
#     * will be happening 
#   * Didn't explain the pre-written code, definitely need to explain everything
#   * I showed how to execute with highlight + run, but didn't show the keyboard shortcut 
#   * If you type something, keep it. If you delete, explain why
